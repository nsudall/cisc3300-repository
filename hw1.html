        1) People can access the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs), also
        known as browsers. They use Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), which are unique addresses 
        for online pages. When someone types a URL into the browser, the browser will utilize a 
        Domain Name System (DNS) server, which will find the location (IP address) of the web 
        server, as web servers can be located anywhere in the world. Web servers host web pages
        specifically designed to connect web pages to requests. Because of this, web
        servers are always connected to the internet.

        2) html (Hypertext Markup Language) is the basic structure for website development, 
        providing the building blocks for webpage formation. It technically is not a programming 
        language as it does not produce dynamic functionality, but is considered the standard 
        for website development.

        3) The Fordham home page presents university news at the forefront of the home page
        which allows the university to showcase information they deem important easily. 
        They provide a bar of larger departments such as academics, athletics, and research, which
        then drops down to smaller subsections, which facilitates navigation without cluttering the
        page

        4) An html tag is what is contained in angle brackets. There are both starting and ending 
        tags, so <h1> </h1> are 2 individual tags. An element includes the starting tag,
        ending tag, and the content in the middle, so <h1> heading </h1> in its entirety is an
        element. An attribute is used to add additional information, such as style, in the 
        starting tag of an element. In <h1 style="color:red;"> red heading </h1>, style="color:red;"
        is the attribute
