1. HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is the method for linking user requests with server responses.
Common request methods include get, post, put, patch, and delete. Get is used to retrieve data, post
adds data to a file, typically saving data onto the website, put is similar to a search and replace, it
finds and relpaces all occurances of the target resource with the request resource. Pacth is similar
to post as it modifys a portion of a resource, and delete will remove the resource.

2. APIs or application programming interface are a method for communication between multiple computers
or programs. Types include browser APIs, jQuery APIs, and Platform APIs. They allow for features
such a geolocation, local storage, user interfaces, and posting data onto their site. JSON stands for 
JavaScript object notation, which is text data that can then be translated into javascript, or the other
way around

3. AJAX or Asynchronous JavaScript And XML allows for fetching data through asynchronous requests for 
a section of a page without requiring the entire page be refreshed. Asynchronous code can run in the 
background without blocking the rest of the code from running. Essentially, the section of code that 
is waiting for the data request can run in the background while the rest of the code develops
