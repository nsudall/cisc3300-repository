1) Javascript is a programming language that allows for webpages to interact dynamically 
    with the user. The webpage can now take information entered by the user, react to 
    certain events, and modify the content of the webpage. A compiled language uses a 
    compiler to change code into machine code. The compiler checks codes for errors before
    allowing code to be run, essentially "proofreading" it. Interpreted languages execute
    each instruction line by line. These differences allow compiled languages to run faster.
    Javascript is an interpreted language.

2) var, const, and let are all keywords that allow the interpreter to know that the rest of 
    the line is a variable declaration. Var is the basic variable declaration that is 
    accessible throughout global and function scopes and can be altered. Const variables, 
    however, cannot be altered once declared. Let is block scoped and is not accessible 
    outside of it. Let's value can be altered after it is declared

3) Anonymous functions do not have a function name. Instead, anonymous functions use function
    expressions which store function values directly into a variable. That variable is then 
    used to access the function. Higher-order functions involve other functions, whether 
    it be returning a function, or taking function results as parameters

4) Objects in Javascript include properties(variables) and methods(functions) that are 
    common in all variations of that object. Javascript is different in its inheritance patterns, as Javascript
    objects can inherit from other objects, which is more flexible than traditional 
    inheritance used by Java. Javascript is also unique in that properties can be added to
    an object after its declaration
