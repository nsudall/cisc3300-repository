    <!-- 
        1) Structural markup in html alters the orgainization or structure of a page as a whole. 
        Examples include headings, paragraphs, and lists. Semantic elements do not change the 
        overall structure of a page, but adds additional information to a text. Examples include
        emphasis showing inportant informtion, or block quotes showing that the text is a quotation

        2) Using correct elements is important for non-human accessors of the website. While one can
        style a paragraph to appear as a heading, browsers will still treat the element as a 
        paragraph, and hence, will be less likely to appear in browser searches. Additionally,
        screen readers treat different elements differently. In order for those readers to experience
        the website as intended, proper elements should be used

        3) Forms in html are used to collect input from the user. Forms are often used to collect 
        usernames and passwords from the user. They can also take the form of search boxes, text boxes,
        uploading files, radio buttons, checkboxes, and drop-down boxes.

        4) Block elements start on a new-line, often adding buffer space between preceeding and
        suceeding elements. They take up the entire width of the page. Examples of a block
        elements are paragraphs and headings. Inline elements, however, do not start on a new line nor
        add buffer space. Instead of taking the entire width, they only take the space they require.
        Examples include images and span.
