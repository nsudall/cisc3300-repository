    a. display: flex
        This will establish a flex container, which can be either inline or block based 
        on the provided value. It also creates a flex context for all of its immediate children.
    b. flex-direction
        This establishes the direction of the flex container, being verticle (upwards or downwards)
        or horizontal (left to right or right to left). Flexbox is a single-direction layout so 
        only one direction can be used
    c. flex-wrap
        Flex attomatically tries to fit all of the content in one line, this instruction
        allows for content to wrap onto the following line.
    d. justify-content/align-items
        controls the location within the contatiner, allowing extra space to be distributed 
        throughout the container depending on the instruction given. Justify is used to
        place along the horizontal axis, whereas align is used for the verticle axis.
    e. align-content
        align-content is similar to justify-content in that it is used to to distribute
        extra space among the elements, this time vertically.
